My name is Henrique Piñeiro Monteagudo. I am Computer Vision engineer :).

## Education
I studied a Computer Vision programme, [IMCV](https://www.imcv.eu/), from three Spanish (Coruña, Santiago de Compostela and Vigo) and one Portuguese (Porto) universities, taught by active researchers in the field. Prior to my master's I studied a BSc in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering in the School of Industrial Engineering at UVigo, with advanced studies on automation. I received a Erasmus scolarship to study abroad at the University of Bologna for one semester. For my BSc thesis, I developed an application for the automatic recognition and inventory of assests in railways using convolutional neural networks. Thanks to this opportunity, I discovered the new degree of automation current computer vision algorithms enable and became eager to learn more about them. The first year of my master's has provided me the necessary tools to understand and build this kind of systems, from basic image processing to complex neural networks.

## Experience
### May 2022 - Aug 2022
Scientific collaborator at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Working in the MMSPG lab on the AdMiRe H2020 project.
### Sep 2021 - Feb 2022: 
Collaborator in research and development at the University of Vigo. Working on deploying and benchmarking SOTA MOT models on the NVidia Jetson platform (mainly Xavier AGX). Using Python, PyTorch and several computer vision libraries as main tools. Working in the [InfraROB](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955337) H2020 project.
### Jun 2021
Currricular internship at [CITIUS](https://citius.usc.es/), an intelligent technologies research centre at the University of Santiago, studying the state of the art of visual recognition models on embedded systems.
### Apr - Jun 2020
Internship at [Insitu Engineering](https://ingenieriainsitu.com/), a technological spin-off from the University of Vigo. Developing an application for the automatic recognition of assets from railway images in the context of a project to reduce maintenance costs in the Spanish railway systems. Development in C++, using Darknet as DL framework. Qt to provide a GUI for the app.
