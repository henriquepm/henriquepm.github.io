My name is Henrique Piñeiro Monteagudo. I am currently a MSc student of the [IMCV](https://www.imcv.eu/), a Computer Vision programme from three Spanish (Coruña, Santiago de Compostela and Vigo) and one Portuguese (Porto) universities, mostly taught by active researchers in the field. I also work at the Applied Geotechnologies research group at the University of Vigo, studying multiple object tracking models on embedded systems for the [InfraROB](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955337) H2020 project.

## Education
Prior to my master's I studied a BSc in Industrial Electronics and Automation Engineering in the School of Industrial Engineering at UVigo, with advanced studies on automation. I received a Erasmus scolarship to study abroad at the University of Bologna for one semester. For my BSc thesis, I developed an application for the automatic recognition and inventory of assests in railways using convolutional neural networks, and discovered my current passion which is computer vision.
